    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    let second_array = players
    //console.log("second_array = ",second_array)
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    second_array[1] = "John"
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // console.log("players array = ",players)
    // console.log("second array = ",second_array)
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const new_array1 = players.slice()
    new_array1[1] = "Bob"
    console.log("new_array1 = ",new_array1)
    //console.log("players array= ",players)
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const new_array2 = [].concat(players)
    new_array2[1] = "Rony"
    console.log("new_array2 = ",new_array2)
    console.log("players array= ",players)
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    let new_array3 = [...players]
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    new_array3[1] = "Jim"
    console.log("new_array = ",new_array3)
    console.log("players array= ",players)
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person
    //captain.number = 99  // adds an attribute number:99 to person object
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({},person,{'number':99,'age':12}) //assigns a new properties 'number' and updates 'age' value only for cap2 object
    console.log("cap2 = ",cap2) 
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
